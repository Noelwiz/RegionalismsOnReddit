A repo for my Sociolinguistics and NLP final projects. Currently a WIP, that I haven't had time to clean up

NOTE: Work in progress. the code needs to be cleaned up still

Made for Python 3.8.

Dependencys:
NLTK
pip install nltk
https://www.nltk.org/

Convo Kit
pip install convokit
https://convokit.cornell.edu/documentation/tutorial.html


getting this code to run:
Either recreate my file structure based on the file locations in the code
or, you can adjust the code to work with what you setup. I used one list
of files which were the unzipped corpuses downloaded from this index
https://zissou.infosci.cornell.edu/convokit/datasets/subreddit-corpus/corpus-zipped/
see the following link for more information
https://convokit.cornell.edu/documentation/subreddit.html

original file structure of data:
data/
 - (state name)
 - - subreddit.corpus
 - - sometimes had a subfolder for a city with multiple subreddits, and then the subreddit.corpus inside that
